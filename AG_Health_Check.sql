-- 1. Check Availability Groups and Replica Roles
# This query gives you a snapshot of who is in the AG, where they are, and how theyâ€™re currently connected and synchronized.
-- ========================================

    drs.is_suspended AS [Is Suspended],                  -- 1 if data movement is suspended

-- 2. Check Databases' Synchronization Status in AG
--# This query drills into the database-level synchronization metrics, giving you insight
--  into replication lag (via queue sizes) and LSN progress to help you troubleshoot latency or data movement issues.
