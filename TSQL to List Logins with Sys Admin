-- SQL to list all logins that are members of the 'sysadmin' fixed server role
-- This query retrieves a list of SQL Server logins that are members of the sysadmin server role
--   â€” which grants unrestricted access to the entire SQL Server instance. 
--     It provides metadata for each login, such as:
--        Login name
--        Login type (SQL login, Windows login, group, etc.)
--        Whether the login is disabled
--        When the login was created or last modified
--  The list is sorted alphabetically by login name.
